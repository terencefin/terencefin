JSON files are the format used by Gather.town to save and display your map. These JSON files have been exported and saved by the Fellowship team, and are the easiest way to clone one of our open source spaces to use yourself.
Thanks to the resource provided here: https://gt-item-shop.web.app/ which allows exporting JSON from Gather.
Use the same resource to upload these files to your own account.
